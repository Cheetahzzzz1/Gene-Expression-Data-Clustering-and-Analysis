# Gene-Expression-Data-Clustering-and-Analysis

# Overview

This project involves clustering gene expression data using dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA) followed by clustering algorithms (K-means). The dataset comprises 40 samples with measurements for 1,000 genes. The objective is to determine whether the data can be clustered into two distinct groups, representing healthy and diseased samples.

# Objective

1. Reduce the dimensionality of the gene expression data using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

2. Perform clustering using K-means with K=2.

3. Evaluate the clustering performance using the Silhoutte score.

4. Visualizd the clustered data.

# Dataset Description

1. **Dataset** : Contains 40 tissue samples and 1,000 gene expression measurement.

2.  **Group Information** : The first 20 samples are from healthy patients, and the next 20 are from diseased patients.
